                <p>Do you find yourself in any situation that looks impossible? Or have men written you off and concluded on 
                    your case? Is it possible that as you are reading this, you have concluded that this is the end for you? I have good news for you; when you have come to the end of yourself, that is when God rolls up his sleeves and gets to work. The bible is not a mere book of history, the things you find in the bible were written for you to understand God. The same power that brought about all the miracles in the bible is at work in your life. So when you face situations that want to swing you off track or throw you down, remember Lazarus who was dead and stinking how Jesus raised him up, remember how God divided the red sea for the Israelites to cross over, remember how Hezekiah faced the wall in prayer and God lengthened his days, remember how Bartimaeus who was blind received his sight, remember how Jesus fed five thousand people, remember
                    how the crippled began to walk, remember Jairus' daughter and many more miracles recorded in the bible. There is nothing too hard for God to do. Whatever you are dealing with know that the same power that made all this miracles happen is working for you. No matter the problem, it is a simple case for El Shaddai!</p>
